Tanabu is an open-source Python package that utilizes quantum machine learning to enhance the accuracy in predicting maintenance of energy grids. Specifically, Tanabu uses a quantum support vector regressor algorithm to take in energy consumption trends and climate data to recommend maintenance in anticipation of potential strain on energy grids.

    Based on the information we have gathered about the energy grid in your location, we have determined that the current energy consumption is within a safe range. Our analysis shows that the energy grid is expected to continue functioning properly without any need for maintenance. We will continue monitoring the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general difuse flows in your location to ensure that the energy grid remains in a stable condition.

                ### Quantum output

    Based on the information we have gathered through the quantum machine learning algorithm, the energy grid may be at risk of failure. We have calculated that the target energy consumption should be around 32344.97 kJ, but the current consumption is at 28468.22 kJ. This means that the energy grid is operating below the expected level, and there is a possibility that it may fail. If the consumption is 75% above or below the expected level, it is highly likely that the grid will fail, and maintenance will be necessary. Therefore, we recommend that maintenance be carried out to ensure the proper functioning of the energy grid.
